# Interactive Bar Plot Visual

During grad school, my data visualization course participated in the 2022 NISS SAID data visualization competition found [here](https://www.niss.org/events/niss-statistically-accurate-interactive-displays-graphics-0). I collaborated with a couple of other classmates to create one complete dashboard using the data provided by NISS. The team split up tasks and the interactive bar plot displayed here on GitHub is the graphic that I was responsible for creating. I decided to make it a standalone dashboard so you can access it [here](https://alizay1.shinyapps.io/interactive-bar-plot-of-education-data/).
